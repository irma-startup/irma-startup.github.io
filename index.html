        <p>Clémentine has a MSc in Power Systems and Associated Markets, and holds a PhD on which she focused on Low Voltage Smart Grids. During her PhD she engaged in the <a href="http://www.kic-innoenergy.com/education/phd-school/">KIC InnoEnergy</a> PhD school program, where she received trainings in innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p> She specialized in distribution networks identification, optimization, state estimation and load forecasting, and therefore developed a global understanding of the electrical network. She worked closely with three distribution network operators (ERDF and GEG in France, TECTEO in Belgium), which has helped understanding the complexity of this sector.</p>

        <p>Florian holds a PhD in signal and image processing from the University of Grenoble-Alpes. His dissertation focused on the development of advanced signal processing theory for bioacoustics, and in particular the study of sounds produced by marine mammals. He held a teaching assistant position at the MSc level between 2011 and 2012, and mentored two interns at Gipsa-lab</p>
        <p>   
        During his PhD he developed strong oral and written communication skills, thanks to a copious amount of talks given in international conferences, as well as the writing of scientific papers, both in French and in English. He is a French, English and Portuguese speaker. He is a strong advocate of the transfer of knowledge, popular science and critical thinking. </p>
